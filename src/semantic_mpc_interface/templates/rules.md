Entities represent equipment or spaces in a model - things with properties.
Values are points
relations are how things are related
Templates should optionally describe everything the user expects they be related with, using relations
Values should have name and value naming aligned so for area, the parameters are 'area_name' and 'area_value'
use _ to separate things within a template. 
map name to the name of the template_name. 

We build upon these conventions to simplify use of surveys, code to assemble templates, etc.
